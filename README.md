# (Work in progress) meanStackWiFi
WiFi Finder / Rater using a MEAN Stack environment

This website will list nearby places with WiFi where people can go and get some work done. It will also display facilities, opening times, a rating, and a location map for each place. Users will be able to log in and submit ratings and reviews.

Uses MongoDB/Mongoose, Express.js, Angular.js(v1) and Node.js (and eventually RESTful API)

Currently prototyped using Jade.js (now Pug.js)
